#What are Database Migrations?

Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner. You could edit fragments of SQL by hand but you would then be responsible for telling other developers that they need to go and run them. Youâ€™d also have to keep track of which changes need to be run against the production machines next time you deploy.

Above from [Rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html).

This Migrations library was inspired by earlier works such as [mysql-php-migrations](https://github.com/davejkiger/mysql-php-migrations),
and implementations found in both Codeigniter and Fulephp frameworks.

##Whats different?

1. Written with php 5.3 and uses [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/components) components and [Doctrine DBAL](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html)
2. Allows each project to define templates using [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).
3. Uses Doctrine DBAL Schema manager to write platform independent migrations or use normal SQL DDL to control your database.
4. All commands accept a [DSN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Source_Name) allowing scripting to apply your migrations to many databases.

##Getting Started
