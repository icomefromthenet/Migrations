The null type is used when a column can contain null values, and you wish
to simulate this behaviour also can effective placeholder placeholder.

There are <strong>no options</strong> for this type.

To declare this time the following format is used.

```xml
<datatype name="null">
</datatype>
```

or

```xml
<datatype name="null" />
```

A better use is to combine with the random selector:

```xml
<random>
    <datatype name="null" />
    ... other type
</random>
```
