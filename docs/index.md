Migration
===========

What are Database Migrations?

> Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner.
> You could edit fragments of SQL by hand but you would then be responsible for telling other developers
> that they need to go and run them. Youâ€™d also have to keep track of which changes need to be run
> against the production machines next time you deploy.

Above from [Rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html).


This Migrations library was inspired by earlier libaries such as the [mysql-php-migrations](https://github.com/davejkiger/mysql-php-migrations),
and later migration implementation found in both Codeignter and Fulephp frameworks.

Whats new and different?
------------------------

1. Writtern with php 5.3 and uses [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/components) components and [Doctrine DBAL](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html)
2. Supports multiple schema's for each project , allows each project to define templates using [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).
3. Uses Doctine DBAL Schema manager to write platform independent migrations (optional).
4. All commands accept a [DSN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Source_Name) which make applying single schema's migrations to many databases easier.
